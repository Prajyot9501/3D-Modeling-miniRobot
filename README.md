# **3D-Modelling-miniRobot**
#### Welcome to my GitHub repository where I showcase a 3D modeled robot created using Autodesk Fusion 360. This project demonstrates my ability to employ advanced CAD modeling techniques and tools, reflecting both my technical precision and creative 
This repository is for my 3D Modeled Robot in Fusion 360

## Features
* While doing this project I leaned advanced modeling techniques as i employed various tools in Fusion 360 such as fillet, mirror, and revolve to enhance the model's design.<br>
* I did detailed 3D Model with comprehensive modeling of each component showcasing complex mechanical designs.
